<p>
  This project was done to implement my knowledge on ReactJs.</p>
  
  <p>It was created using reusable components such as the destination card that will get all info from the database and populate with automatically when a new location is added to the databese.</p>
  <p> Also the globe icon at the navbar and the pin icon were created as components importing the images locally.
